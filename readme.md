### Features:
+ Proxy support
+ Message queue to avoid rate limits

### Use it on your own risk.
You have to understand that selfbots are against Discord TOS, and there is a great chance your account will get terminated using one.

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Z1xus/self-reaction-bot
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```
3. Configure the bot
```python
# in case you got rate limited
use_proxy = False
proxy = "http://localhost:8080"

# channel ids where the bot listens for messages
allowed_ids = [1234567890123456789, ...]

# reactions list in unicode, emoji and escape formats
reactions = ["ðŸ‡§", "ðŸ‡®", "ðŸ‡¹", "ðŸ‡¨", "ðŸ‡­"]

# random delay range in seconds
min_delay = 1
max_delay = 5

# change yo user token
user_token = "..."
```
